            <h2>ðŸ‘‹ Meet the Developer</h2>
            <p>
                Hi there! I'm <strong>Sukhman</strong>, a passionate backend developer. While most of my projects focus heavily on backend architecture and logic, this project represents one of my early ventures into creating a polished user interface.
            </p>
            <p>
                Alongside my academic projects, I've also been fortunate to gain experience through various <strong>co-op internships</strong>, where I honed my problem-solving and programming skills in real-world applications.
            </p>

            <h3>ðŸŽ¯ Another Purpose Behind This Project</h3>
            <p>
                Throughout the first two years of university, Iâ€™ve maintained a GPA of <strong>4.13</strong> while excelling in courses like Calculus I, II, and III. Many students from lower academic years often ask me how to sustain such performance.
            </p>
            <p>
                This inspired me to create this <strong>study-focused program</strong>â€”a structured approach to help others develop effective study habits, stay organized, and achieve academic excellence.
